Smarter Platform
=================

The Smarter platform is a batteries-included solution
that is designed to provide large organizations with a robust and scalable foundation
for deploying and managing AI applications in production environments.

Smarter runs natively on Kubernetes in the cloud at Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It provides the necessary infrastructure and services to host and manage
AI-driven workflows, agents and chatbots that are securely integrated to
enterprise data sources and systems.

The Smarter platform's fundamental building blocks to this extent are:

- This documentation. See `Smarter Documentation <https://docs.smarter.sh/>`__
- Managed Docker containers. See `Smarter on DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/mcdaniel0073/smarter>`__
- Managed Helm charts. See `Smarter Helm Chart <https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?repo=project-smarter>`__
- Managed cloud infrastructure. See `Smarter Terraforms <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-infrastructure>`__
- Broad support for our developer ecosystem. See `Smarter Developer Resources <https://smarter.sh/>`__
