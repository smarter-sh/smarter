Backup and Restore
==================

All of Smarter's data is stored in the backing Sql database that you have configured for use with
Smarter. Therefore, backing up and restoring Smarter is primarily a matter of backing up and
restoring the Sql database.

If you choose a managed database service, such as AWS Relational Database Service (RDS), then you
can use the backup and restore features provided by that service. If you are managing your own
database server, then you will need to configure the backup and restore tools provided by your
database software.

**Smarter does not provide any built-in backup or restore functionality.**
