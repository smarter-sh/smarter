Cloud Infrastructure
====================

Running Smarter in production in the cloud requires some additional configuration and setup. Smarter
currently support AWS as its sole cloud infrastructure provider. The project maintains a set of
Terraform scripts to fully automate the deployment and management of all AWS infrastructure
resources required for normal operation of the Smarter platform.

These scripts can be found in the `https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-infrastructure <https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-infrastructure>`- repository.
See the README file in that repository for detailed instructions on how to use Terraform scripts
to deploy and manage Smarter infrastructure on AWS.
