ADR
===

Architectural Design Records (ADRs) are short documents that capture a single architectural or design decision, its context, and its consequences. Less is more, keep these brief.
Each ADR is a separate markdown file located in this directory. ADRs provide a clear, version-controlled history of why decisions were made.

See: `Michael Nygard’s ADRs <https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html>`_
