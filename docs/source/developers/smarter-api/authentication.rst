Authentication
================================

The Smarter platform uses an Api key-based proprietary authentication strategy
based on Django Rest Framework's knox token authentication. Api keys are used
for the command-line interface as well as for deployed ChatBots/Agents that
are configured to use authentication. See :doc:`../smarter-token-authentication` for details.
