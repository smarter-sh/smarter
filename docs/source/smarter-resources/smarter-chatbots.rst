Smarter Chatbots
================

Smarter Chatbots are highly advanced conversational agents designed to provide
intelligent and context-aware interactions with human users as well as
fully automated workflows. They leverage the vanguard
of generative AI text completion technology to deliver personalized and efficient
responses. Namely, these chatbots leverage the Smarter Plugin architecture, which
provides extensible tool integration capabilities, including secure access to
to private, secure data sources and external APIs.

ChatBots are recognized by the yaml-based Smarter Api Manifest (SAM) architecture,
facilitating both behavioral and visual customization. This allows developers to
tailor the chatbot's functionality and appearance to meet specific use cases and
user preferences.

ChatBots are managed with the Smarter command-line interface (CLI).

.. note::

   The term 'ChatBot' is used interchangeably with 'Agent' and 'Workflow Unit' throughout
