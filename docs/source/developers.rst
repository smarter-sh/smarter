Smarter is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.
This section provides guidelines and resources to help you get started with contributing to the Smarter codebase.

Alternatively, if you've forked the repository and want to understand how to build and test your changes locally,
you'll find detailed instructions here as well.
