Django
========

Smarter builds on the robust foundation of the Django web framework, extending
its capabilities to support AI resource management and enterprise developer needs.
Importantly, Smarter does not modify or override Django’s core functionality; instead,
it adds features in a way that preserves full compatibility and future-proofing
with upstream Django releases.

Our approach is guided by simplicity: we minimize the use of additional
Django-related PyPI packages, ensuring that the framework remains lightweight and maintainable.
Smarter’s extensions are purpose-driven, aligning with our mission to deliver
scalable, intelligent resource management for modern organizations.
