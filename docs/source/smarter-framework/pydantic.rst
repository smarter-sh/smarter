Pydantic
========

Smarter’s entire YAML manifest-based data model is built on top of the Pydantic library,
without any changes or extensions to Pydantic itself. This approach ensures maximum
compatibility, stability, and future-proofing as the platform evolves.

We emphasize simplicity and elegance in the design of Smarter’s fundamental AI
resource data model, enabling long-term growth and minimizing the risk of breaking
changes. By leveraging Pydantic’s proven capabilities, Smarter provides a
robust foundation for scalable and maintainable data validation.
