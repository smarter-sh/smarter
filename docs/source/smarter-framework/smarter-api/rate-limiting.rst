Rate Limiting
===============

Smarter API is built on top of Django and Django REST Framework, which provides
robust support for rate limiting through throttling classes. Refer
to the `Django REST Framework documentation on throttling
<https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/>`_ for more details.
