Django Rest Framework
========================

Smarter extends the Django REST framework (DRF) to support advanced AI resource management
and enterprise developer workflows, while preserving the integrity of DRF’s core functionality.
No changes or overrides are made to the underlying DRF codebase, ensuring full
compatibility and future-proofing with upstream releases.

Our philosophy is to keep things simple: we minimize the use of additional
Django and DRF-related PyPI packages, maintaining a lightweight and maintainable framework.
Smarter’s enhancements are purpose-built to align with our mission, delivering
scalable and intelligent solutions for modern organizations.

For more information about DRF, see the `official Django REST framework documentation <https://www.django-rest-framework.org/>`_.
