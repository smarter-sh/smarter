Smarter Web Dashboard
======================

The web console principally exists in order to provide access to `Django Admin <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/ref/contrib/admin/>`__
and to host the Prompt Engineer Workbench. However, the Smarter Framework also includes a
customizable dashboard application that you can use in conjunction with Wagtail to
a highly personalized experience for your users.
