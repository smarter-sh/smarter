      aboutPlugins: |
        Smarter plugins are built on a Large Language Model (LLM) API edge feature generally referred to as, "Function Calling", that a growing population of LLM's include in their APIs. The basic use case of "Function Calling" is as follows: you write your own custom function in say, Python, and then when prompting the LLM, you include a human-readable description of your function's use case and its API using the LLM's prescribed API description protocol, which is typically provided in JSON format, similar to say, a JSON schema for a data model. The LLM decides whether or not to invoke your function based on its own analysis of each incoming prompt as weighed against the function description and API that you provided. The LLM, at its sole discretion, will invoke your function if and only if it believes that the function results could lead to a better, higher quality prompt response. Function Calling is an astonishingly powerful yet tragically underutilized feature of LLMs, mostly because it depends on advanced programming skills that tend to fall outside of the learning journey of many otherwise objectively highly skilled prompt engineers.

        The OpenAI API documentation for "Function Calling" includes a great example use case called "Current Weather". If you include this function calling API in an OpenAI API prompt, and your text prompt includes even the slightest reference to weather, then unsurprisingly the gpt family of models all do a pretty commendable job of correctly determining that the prompt will benefit from knowing some hard data about the current weather. Moreover, GPT (and many other) models do a remarkably good job of word-smithing the function response's data into a final response. Somewhat anticlimatically however, OpenAI's documentation fails to provide the source code for the actual function implementation, leaving the climactic tension sort of hanging in suspended animation, kind of like Wylie Coyote in a Bugs Bunny/Road Runner cartoon scene. But not to worry, we did that for you! The "current weather" function is built in to the Smarter platform, and it's part of the "hello world!" getting started Learning journey, as a kind of stepping stone towards understanding how Smarter Plugins work.

        You can include as many functions in LLM prompt requests as you like, taking into consideration however, that each of these incrementally increases the overall token cost for each prompt request. And therein lies the conundrum. Costs start piling up really fast as your prompts become bloated with tokenized function calling APIs that at any rate rarely get selected by the LLM. What's the wisdom in creating an expansive library of bespoke functions if they're infrequently chosen by the LLM, but regardless, you're always billed for their presence in your prompt requests? Answer to follow, in just a moment.

        Smarter plugins generalize the LLM "Function Calling" API, by essentially providing a parameterized user-defined API on top of the LLM API. They additionally provide common data connectors for querying and delivering hard data results. The simplest of these is a Static data set, in which you simply provide the hard data in the form of a Smarter manifest. But Smarter also provides enterprise-grade connectors for common kinds of SQL databases as well as for REST API's. Creating an ad hoc SQL connector is as simple as the following example SqlConnector manifest

      technicalDocumentation: |
        Smarter provides a comprehensive set of technical documentation for developers, system administrators, and end users.
        This documentation includes manifest documentation, self-onboarding tutorials, command-line interface (CLI) documentation,
        api documentation, developer resources, and the Smarter developer team.

        For more information, visit the [Smarter Documentation Portal](https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/) or contact
        Lawrence McDaniel at +1 (617) 834-6172 or email [lawrence@querium.com](mailto:lawrence@querium.com).

        Check out Smarter on GitHub for code samples, at [https://github.com/smarter-sh/](https://github.com/smarter-sh/).
        You should also take a look at these sample manifests for deploying AI resources on the Smarter platform,
        [https://github.com/smarter-sh/examples/](https://github.com/smarter-sh/examples/).

        the command-line interface (CLI) for the Smarter platform is [free to download](https://smarter.sh/cli/).
        It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Docker. The CLI provides a powerful set of tools for managing AI resources,
        including model training, deployment, monitoring, scaling, api key management and user management.
        The CLI is built with Golang and is open source and available on Github at [https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli](https://github.com/smarter-sh/smarter-cli).

        example cli commands:
        - smarter get chatbots
        - smarter apply -f chatbot.yaml
        - smarter delete chatbot my-chatbot
        - smarter get plugins
        - smarter describe plugin --name my-plugin
        - smarter manifest plugin

        the Smarter platform provides a powerful API for managing AI resources. The API is RESTful and is accessible
        via HTTP requests. The API provides endpoints for managing AI resources, creation, deployment,
        monitoring, scaling, and user management. The API is documented in the Smarter documentation portal at
        [https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/api/](https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/api/).

        example API endpoints:
        - GET /api/v1/chatbots
        - GET /api/v1/chats
        - POST /api/v1/apply
        - DELETE /api/v1/chatbots/my-chatbot
        - GET /api/v1/plugins
        - GET /api/v1/plugins/my-plugin
        - POST /api/v1/plugins

      auditLoggingAndSecurity: |
        Smarter provides detailed, customizable backend logging and monitoring. Logging is configurable in real-time
        via the use of Django waffle switches, available to administrators inside the admin console. Logs can optionally
        be sent to a third-party logging service such as Loggly, Splunk, or Sumo Logic and CloudWatch.

        The Smarter backend is developed on Python-Django and includes a number of security-conscious design features common to Django
        including
          1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Django provides middleware to protect against CSRF attacks by ensuring that POST requests are accompanied by a secret token.
          2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection: Django automatically escapes special characters in HTML templates to prevent XSS attacks.
          3. SQL Injection Protection: Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) automatically escapes SQL queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
          4. Clickjacking Protection: Django includes middleware to prevent clickjacking attacks by setting the X-Frame-Options header.
          5. Secure Password Storage: Django uses PBKDF2 by default to hash passwords, and it supports other secure hashing algorithms like Argon2, bcrypt, and SHA-1.
          6. HTTPS Support: Django encourages the use of HTTPS by providing settings to enforce secure connections, such as SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT and SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS.
          7. Content Security Policy (CSP): Django allows you to set CSP headers to prevent various types of attacks, including XSS and data injection attacks.
          8. Host Header Validation: Django validates the Host header to prevent HTTP Host header attacks.
          9. Session Security: Django provides secure session management, including settings for session expiration and secure cookies.
          10. Security Middleware: Django includes several security middleware options, such as SecurityMiddleware, which can be configured to enforce various security policies.
        These features help developers build secure applications by providing protection against common web vulnerabilities.

        Moreover, Smarter runs on Kubernetes cloud infrastructure, which provides additional security features such as
          1. Network Policies: Kubernetes allows you to define network policies to control traffic between pods and services.
          2. Pod Security Policies: Kubernetes lets you define pod security policies to control the security context of pods.
          3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Kubernetes provides RBAC to control access to resources based on roles and role bindings.
          4. Secrets Management: Kubernetes provides a secure way to manage sensitive information such as passwords and API keys.
          5. Container Runtime Security: Kubernetes supports container runtime security features like seccomp, AppArmor, and SELinux.
          6. Admission Controllers: Kubernetes admission controllers allow you to enforce custom policies for pod creation and modification.
          7. Pod Security Context: Kubernetes lets you define security context settings at the pod level to control the security settings of containers.
          8. Network Policies: Kubernetes network policies allow you to define rules for controlling ingress and egress traffic to pods.
          9. Service Mesh: Kubernetes service mesh solutions like Istio provide additional security features like mutual TLS, rate limiting, and access control.

        Lastly, Smarter uses Terraform for infrastructure as code, which allows us to define granular network security rules, IAM policies,
        and other security configurations in code. This ensures that security configurations are version-controlled, auditable, and reproducible.
        Smarter's infrastructure is deployed on AWS, which provides a wide range of security features and services to protect our cloud environment.
        For example, AWS offers services like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS Key Management Service (KMS), AWS CloudTrail,
        to help us secure our cloud resources. Our VPC architecture is designed to isolate different components of the Smarter platform,
        and we use security groups and network ACLs to control traffic between different parts of the platform. This not only optimizes
        performance but also enhances security by limiting the attack surface and preventing lateral movement within the platform.

      organization or classroom. If the user is not interested in Smarter, ask them why, and what features or capabilities
      they would like to see in the platform to make it more appealing to them.

      Finally, provide a call to action, such as, "Would you like to learn more about Smarter?", or "Would you like to
      schedule a demo of Smarter?", or "Would you like to speak with a Smarter sales representative?". If the user
      responds positively, provide them with this link to the [Smarter website contact form](https://smarter.sh/contact/),
      or to the [Smarter demo scheduling page](https://smarter.sh/contact/), or to the [Smarter sales contact page](https://smarter.sh/contact/).

      During initial conversations you can refer to the "interesting facts" from the tool provided for ice breaker materials,
      or to keep the conversation going.
